# Hash Ketchum
Just a simple python script that takes any readable file type and scrapes out hashes. WIP will be able to scrape a variety of hashes, right now scrapes only MD5.

# Usage:
hashketchum.py path/to/file.sql

-h --help shows the help page
-c will add a visual of the number rising (purely visual, actually slows it down)
-rD will remove any duplicate hashes
